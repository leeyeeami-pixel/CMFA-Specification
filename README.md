# CMFA v0.1.1 Release Candidate

Updated release package with full core specs.
# CMFA — Composable Modular Fabric Architecture

**CMFA** is an open specification proposal for a next-generation AI-native PC architecture:

- Modular compute bricks instead of monolithic motherboards  
- Capability-addressed fabric routing instead of fixed buses  
- Reflex-grade safety and emergency event planes  
- Hot-pluggable CPU/GPU/Memory/Storage building blocks  
- Designed for future AI-first personal systems  

CMFA aims to define a new interoperable hardware ecosystem, similar in spirit to:

- PCI-SIG (PCI Express)
- NVMe Consortium
- USB-IF
- Khronos Group

## Vision

Traditional PCs are built around a single motherboard with tightly bound components.

CMFA proposes a different model:

> A PC as a composable fabric of autonomous compute organs.

A CMFA system behaves more like a distributed organism:

- Compute Bricks execute workloads  
- Memory Bricks provide pooled low-latency caching  
- GPU Bricks accelerate AI + graphics  
- Power Bricks enforce safety reflex shutdown  
- Switch Bricks route by capability, not slot number
